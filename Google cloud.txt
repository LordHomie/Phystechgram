1- make a google business account if you dont have.
2- enable billing.
3- enable billing in Kubernetes.
4- read the document and deploy a simple hello world program, then do it for your project. In the documentation, start from the point "Building the container image"

https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app?authuser=1

Note1: when you clone to your github repository, type ls
Then, you will get the existing folders.
Type: cd "name of the folder"

In this case of Phystechgram, type:
git clone https://github.com/LordHomie/Phystechgram.git
ls
cd Phystechgram/


Note2: Don't forget to use the ID of your own project which is shown up in the website of console.cloud.google.com

In this case it will be:

The name of project was "My First Project"
The ID is midyear-pattern-298211

So, just do this only in this area:
export PROJECT_ID=midyear-pattern-298211


Note3: 
When reaching to this point "Pushing the Docker image to Container Registry", type this:

gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com


Note4: 
In this point "Creating a GKE cluster", 
make the compute/zone to "europe-north1-b" as it's near from Russia.

So, it will be like this:
gcloud config set compute/zone europe-north1-b
